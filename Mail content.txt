Notes for developers:

- EmailJS template variables (example):
  - to_name, to_email, room, date, time
  - Example template params object:
    {
      to_name: payload.to_name,
      to_email: payload.to,
      room: payload.room,
      date: payload.date,
      time: payload.start + ' - ' + payload.end
    }

- PHPMailer/Server-side plain-text message (same content):

  $subject = 'Meeting Booking Approved';
  $message = "Hello " . $name . ",\n\n";
  $message .= "Your booking for " . $room . " on " . $date . " has been approved.\n\n";
  $message .= "Time: " . $start . " - " . $end . "\n\n";
  $message .= "If you have any questions, contact support.\n\nRegards,\nMeeting Booking Team";

- Placeholders in `admin/index.php` for EmailJS must be replaced with your EmailJS User ID, Service ID, and Template ID.

- If you want an HTML version, wrap the body in HTML tags and set the EmailJS/PHPMailer to send HTML.
